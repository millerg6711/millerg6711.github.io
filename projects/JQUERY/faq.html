                        <h3>What is BMI?</h3>
                        <div>
                            <p>BMI is an acronym for Body Mass Index, and it is an indicator of the amount of fat which
                                is
                                stored in the human body. It provides a measure of the appropriateness of your weight
                                to
                                your height, based on health issues which are known to arise as a result of having a
                                BMI
                                which is too low or too high.</p>
                        </div>
                        <h3>Who invented BMI?</h3>
                        <div>
                            <p>The BMI formula and its name were invented by different people, living in different
                                centuries. The BMI formula was developed in the 1830s by Adolphe Quetelet, a Belgian
                                mathematician and social statistician. He used his skills in calculus and statistics to
                                analyse the relationship between height and weight in populations, and formulated what
                                was
                                known for 140 years as the Quetelet Index. In 1972 the American biologist and
                                physiologist
                                Ancel Keys published a paper endorsing the validity of the index, and in the process he
                                renamed it and popularised it as the Body Mass Index.</p>
                        </div>
                        <h3>Why is BMI important?</h3>
                        <div>
                            <p>BMI is important as it is able to predict, with considerable accuracy, mortality and
                                morbidity rates in populations. What this means is that BMI is not only able to predict
                                the
                                rates at which people within a given population or group will die and suffer disease,
                                but
                                it is able to predict the incidence of the different types of diseases which occur in
                                the
                                population and which cause those deaths. However, as Adolphe Quetelet and Ancel Keys
                                stressed, BMI's predictive abilities apply to populations only, and not to individuals
                                within it.</p>

                        </div>
                        <h3>How is BMI calculated?</h3>
                        <div>
                            <p>BMI is calculated using only the variables of weight and height. Your BMI is equal to
                                your
                                weight in kilograms divided by your height in metres squared. You can also calculate
                                your
                                BMI using imperial units, in which case your BMI is equal to your weight in pounds
                                divided
                                by your height in inches squared, multiplied by 703.</p>

                        </div>
                        <h3>When should BMI be used?</h3>
                        <div>
                            <p>The calculation of BMI can be used for males and non-pregnant females between the ages
                                of 18
                                and 65. Although BMI is calculated for children in exactly the same way as for adults,
                                the
                                results are used in an entirely different way and for that reason a standard BMI
                                calculator
                                should not be used for those under the age of 18. Also, the physiology of elderly
                                people
                                differs from other adults (due to factors such as muscle wasting and height reduction),
                                and
                                consequently BMI calculations should not be made for that group. BMI calculations are
                                also
                                unsuitable for those who have developed significant amounts of muscle mass through
                                physical
                                exercise, as the results will tend to indicate higher levels of body fat than is
                                actually
                                the case.</p>

                                <li>Overweight is defined as a body mass index of 25.0 to less than 30.0 kg/m².</li>
                                <li>Obesity is defined as a BMI of 30.0 kg/m² or greater.</li>
